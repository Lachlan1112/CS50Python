      <th>SSD (Solid State Drive)</th>
      <th>	• Stores a charge in memory cells, the charge can represent different values. <br>
        • Memory cells are collected together in vertical strings, in turn these are collected as pages<br>
        • Bit lines can read the charge in each cell<br>
        • Bit lines can also change the charge to store new data
      Uses NAND gate technology</th>
      <th>• Highly Durable<br>
      • Partable<br>
      • Contains minimal moving part<br>
      • Lower energy usage<br>
      • Faster re-write speeds</th>
      <th>• Higher cost per gigabite<br>
      • Lower storage density when compared to other devices<br>
      • Charge in cells can be lost over time</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Optical Storage</th>
      <th>	• Data is stored through the use of millions of microscopic pits and lands.<br>
        • These are created by shining a layer over the surface 
      A laser beam is used to read data as the disk spins. Pits and lands are distinguished by how the light reflects off the recording display</th>
      <th>Can hold a lot more data than a standard DVD, meaning it can store movies with better picture and sound quality.<br>
      Optical disks are more durable than both Volatile and memories that are non-Volatile. It’s not subjected to wear and now any charged power failures may cause data losses. Therefore, it should last long for many years. Nevertheless, it’s not completely protected against scratching, heat as well as other sorts of physical damages.</th>
      <th>More expensive than DVDs. Requires a Blu-ray player. Can lose data when scratched.<br>
      Optical disks cost more per GB/TB than the other sorts of storage drives. And it also to don’t have a lot of or no storage capacity when compared with them. Unless it’s a Blu-ray disc, the utmost storage the Optical disks offers is 4.7GB.</th>

    <tr>
      <th>Magnetic Storage</th>
      <th>	• 0 and 1 represented by positive and negative magnetic charge.<br>
        • Read/write head floats 5 nanometers above platter(the spinning disk).<br>
        • Some drives have multiple platers and/or have double sided platters. <br>
        • Overly compacting data causes the charges to interfere with each other<br>
        • The write head can change the charge. <br>
        • The read head can read the charge<br>
      Platters are made of glass and covered with magnetic surface or material</th>
      <th>	• Cheaper than ssd <br>
      High storage capacity</th>
      <th>	• Can be easily broken<br>
        • Magnetic platers are heavy<br>
        • Slower reading compared to SSD<br>
        • High energy use<br>
      Hard to mass produce.</th>
